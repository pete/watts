All of the examples are standalone Watts applications, which you can run
directly.  They could all be pretty easily turned into rackup files.

hello_world.rb is the most basic demonstration.
matching.rb shows how Watts's pattern-matching works.
hoshi.rb is a demonstration of the view-wrapping resource.
environment.rb shows what you have to work with in your request.

Although they're all single-file applications, there's nothing that
prevents you from splitting things up arbitrarily.  It's all just Ruby.
