All of the examples are standalone Watts applications, which you can run
directly.  To run them, you can use the command.
	rackup file.ru

* hello_world.ru is the most basic demonstration.
* matching.ru shows how Watts's pattern-matching works.
* hoshi.ru is a demonstration of the view-wrapping resource.
* environment.ru shows what you have to work with in your request.

Although they're all single-file applications, there's nothing that
prevents you from splitting things up arbitrarily.  It's all just Ruby.
