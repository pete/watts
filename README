=Watts

==Intro
Watts is a minimalist, Rack-based, resource-oriented web framework.  It
has roughly 10% as many lines of code as Sinatra, and it only does one
thing:  it maps resources.

==Goals
Dead-simple web development.  I don't want a framework to take up so
much of my brain that there's no space left for my application.

==Resource Orientation
If you think of resources as first-class objects, and then think of HTTP
methods as operations on those objects, then this should probably make
sense.

Most of the web frameworks I have seen seem to be HTTP-method-oriented
rather than resource-oriented.  It seems odd to me (not to mention
repetitive) that you would type "A GET on /foo does this, a POST on /foo
does that, ..." rather than "There's a resource at /foo.  That
resource's GET does this, and its POST does that, ...".

And because the second one made more sense to me, that's how I wrote
Watts.  Let me clarify if that was a bit vague, by showing how a Watts
app comes into being:
* You make a resource by sub-classing Watts::Resource.  
* On this resource, you define some basic operations, in terms of HTTP
methods.
* You create an app by sub-classing Watts::App.
* You use the resource() method to tell Watts the path under which the
resource can be found.

There are a few easy-to-read examples in doc/examples.

==REST, RFC 2616, TL;DR
There's a lot of talk on the internets about what exactly REST is, why
it's important, why we're doing it wrong, content-negotiation,
discoverability, avoiding out-of-band communication, and all of that
stuff.  Good gravy!  Great chowder, man!  Boring!  Watts makes it a
little easier to comply with the spec than Rails or Sinatra if you know
what the spec says, but it doesn't get all in your face about that stuff
if you don't care.

==Bugs
I'm sure they're present.  You can email me about them, or ping me on
GitHub, or send a patch.

==Author
I wrote it.

==About the Name
I named it after a character in a video game that I liked as a kid.
It's also the name of a city not far from where I live.

Also:  one joule per second.

==Okay, Seriously.
Pete Elmore.  Feel free to email me using pete at debu dot gs.  I'm on
GitHub at http://github.com/pete .  Also there's http://debu.gs/ , which
I hope to soon rewrite in Watts.
